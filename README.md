# Compile and Run

Method 1 and method 3 data can be shared, while method 2 data is independent (in jar).

### Method 1: Run by terminal

Open the terminal, enter the directory where the README file is located, and enter the following commands in sequence.

```cmd
javac -encoding UTF-8 @source.txt
cd src
java gui.login.Login
```

It needs to wait to compile the code.

### Method 2: Run by terminal through jar file

Open the terminal, enter the directory where the README file is located, and enter the following commands in sequence.

```cmd
cd src
java â€“jar Group85.jar
```

### Method 3: Run by .bat (Windows)

At the address where the README file is located, create a new .txt file and write the following content:

```bat
cd %CD%
start cmd /k "javac -encoding UTF-8 @source.txt & cd src & java gui.login.Login"
```

Change the file suffix from ".txt" to ".bat". Then double-click the .bat file and wait for the compilation to be completed before running the program.

**Alternatively**, you can also double-click the `start up.bat ` provided by us to compile the code and start the program automatically.

It needs to wait to compile the code.
